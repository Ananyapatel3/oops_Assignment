    "Inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from another class. Inheritance enables code reusability and allows us to create new classes based on existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four types of inheritance in Python. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single inheritance: When a class inherits from only one base class, it is called single inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        \n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, color):\n",

    "print(my_car.make)  # Output: Toyota\n",
    "print(my_car.color)  # Output: red\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the `Car` class inherits from the `Vehicle` class. `Vehicle` class has two attributes `make` and `model`. The `Car` class also has a `color` attribute in addition to the `make` and `model` attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multiple inheritance: When a class inherits from two or more base classes, it is called multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "        \n",
    "class Employee:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, id, salary):\n",
    "        self.id = id\n",
    "        self.salary = salary\n",
    "        \n",
    "class Manager(Person, Employee):\n",

    "\n",
    "my_manager = Manager(\"John\", 35, 1001, 50000)\n",
    "print(my_manager.name)  # Output: John\n",
    "print(my_manager.salary)  # Output: 50000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the `Manager` class inherits from both the `Person` and `Employee` classes. `Person` class has `name` and `age` attributes and `Employee` class has `id` and `salary` attributes. The `Manager` class has access to all the attributes from both the base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Hierarchical inheritance: When two or more classes inherit from a single base class, it is called hierarchical inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        \n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",

    "    \n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def meow(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Meow meow!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "my_cat = Cat(\"Kitty\")\n",
    "print(my_dog.name)  # Output: Buddy\n",
    "print(my_cat.name)  # Output: Kitty\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, both the `Dog` and `Cat` classes inherit from the `Animal` class. The `Animal` class has only one attribute `name` and both `Dog` and `Cat` classes have access to this attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Multilevel inheritance: When a class is derived from a derived class, it is called multilevel inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        \n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, color):\n",
    "        super().__init__(make, model)\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "\n",
    "class SportsCar(Car):\n",
    "    def top_speed(self, speed):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.make} {self.model} can go up to {speed} mph!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "my_sports_car = SportsCar(\"Ferrari\", \"488 GTB\", \"red\")\n",
    "my_sports_car.top_speed(205)  # Output: Ferrari 488 GTB can go up to 205 mph!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the `SportsCar` class inherits from the `Car` class, which in turn inherits from the `Vehicle` class. The `SportsCar` class has an additional method `top_speed()` that calculates the top speed of the car based on its make and model."
